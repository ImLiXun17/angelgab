After watching **Sessions Tutorials** answer the following:

 question:What function do we use to start a session?
 answer: The function to start a session is session_start(); This function initializes a new or existing session and makes session variables available to your PHP scripts.
         Once you've called session_start(), you can use the $_SESSION superglobal to store and retrieve data between page requests.


 question:Where are these session variables stored?
 answer: These variables strored in server side The actual data stored in the session variables (i.e., the values you set using $_SESSION) is stored on the server side, associated with the session ID. By default, PHP stores session data in files in a directory specified by the session.save_path configuration directive. 
         However, you can also configure PHP to store session data in a database or in memory, depending on your needs.
